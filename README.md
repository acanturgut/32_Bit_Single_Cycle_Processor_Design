**32-Bit Single Cycle Processor Design**

 - This project requires Logism Software.   
 - Please download it from there [Link](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

> Logisim is a software logic simulator which provides basic components
> to build a simple processor.

In this project we will design and implement a 32-bit processor using Logisim.  This processor work with basic MIPS instructions.  

This project was done for Ko√ß University COMP 303 - Computer Architecture Course.
